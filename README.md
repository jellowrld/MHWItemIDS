Step 1: Install Python

        ItemIDS.ods

    Open a terminal or command prompt again.
    Navigate to the folder where your files are saved. For example, if it’s in C:\MonsterHunterApp, you would type:

A window will open. You can type item names, and the app will show matching items and their IDs.
