Step 1: Install Python

    Download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
    Install Python and make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

    Open a terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS or Linux).
    Install the libraries by typing the following commands one by one and pressing Enter:

pip install pandas
pip install fuzzywuzzy
pip install PyQt6
pip install odfpy

Step 3: Save Your Code

    Create a folder on your computer, for example, name it MonsterHunterApp.
    Inside the MonsterHunterApp folder, create a new file and name it main.py.
    Copy the Python code you provided and paste it into the main.py file.

Step 4: Add Your ODS File

    Download or place the ItemIDS.ods file in the same folder as your main.py.

Step 5: Run the Program

    Open a terminal or command prompt again.
    Navigate to the folder where your main.py is saved. For example, if it’s in C:\MonsterHunterApp, you would type:

cd C:\MonsterHunterApp

Run the Python script by typing:

    python main.py

Step 6: Use the App

A window will open. You can type item names, and the app will show matching items and their IDs.
